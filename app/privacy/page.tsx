            your name and email from Google or Microsoft when you sign in, calendar tokens you grant
            us so we can read availability and write events, and the bookings made through your link.
          </p>

            If you use our SMS features, we also collect your phone number, message content,
            delivery status, and timestamps for text messages sent or received through the Service.
